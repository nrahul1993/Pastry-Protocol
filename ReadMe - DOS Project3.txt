What is working:
We are passing the number of nodes and number of requests. The given number of nodes are created and joined to the network. 
Then each of the nodes are sending(routing) the given number of requests(messages). Once each nodes sends that many requests, it terminates. 
We tried for 32 bits and b=4. 
We also managed to execute the failure case(bonus)
